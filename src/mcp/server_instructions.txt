# RAG Memory - AI Agent Usage Guide

## System Architecture
Dual-storage knowledge management:
- **Vector Store** (PostgreSQL+pgvector): Semantic search via embeddings
- **Knowledge Graph** (Neo4j+Graphiti): Entity relationships and temporal reasoning

**IMPORTANT:** Every ingestion writes to BOTH stores using AI models (embeddings + LLMs). Ingestion has cost. Queries are free (local database operations).

## 1. COLLECTION DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL)

**MUST review collections before ingesting ANY content:**

1. `list_collections()` - See available collections
2. `get_collection_info(name)` - Review purpose, domain, metadata schema
3. Choose collection matching content's domain/topic
4. If no good match: `create_collection()` with clear domain/purpose

**Why:** Collections partition BOTH vector search AND knowledge graph. Poor collection choices degrade knowledge quality and search relevance.

**Never:**
- Dump unrelated content into same collection
- Ignore collection descriptions when choosing where to ingest
- Create collections without clear, focused domain/purpose
- Ingest before reviewing what collections already exist

**Pattern:**
```
list_collections()
  → review purposes/domains
  → choose best fit OR create new
  → ingest_*(collection_name=chosen)
```

---

## 2. SEARCH: USE FULL QUESTIONS (NOT KEYWORDS)

**Semantic search matches MEANING, not exact words.**

✅ Good: "How do I configure authentication in the system?"
❌ Bad: "authentication configuration"

Applies to: `search_documents`, `query_relationships`, `query_temporal`

## 3. INGESTION WORKFLOWS

### Check Before Ingesting (Avoid Duplicates)
```
list_documents(collection_name, include_details=True)
  → Review titles/metadata
  → If exists unchanged: SKIP
  → If exists but updated: update_document()
  → If new: ingest_*()
```

**Why:** Avoids redundant processing and maintains clean knowledge base.

### Analyze Before Multi-Page Crawls (REQUIRED)
```
# STEP 1: Analyze website structure
analysis = analyze_website(url, include_url_lists=True)
  → Returns: total_urls, pattern_stats, elapsed_seconds
  → Note: Uses AsyncUrlSeeder with sitemap+cc fallback

# STEP 2: Review scope and plan strategy
  → If total_urls <= 20: Single targeted crawl
  → If total_urls > 20: Multiple targeted crawls (max_pages=20 per crawl)
  → Review pattern_stats to identify sections (/api, /guides, /reference)

# STEP 3: Execute crawl(s)
ingest_url(
    url=target_url,
    follow_links=True,
    max_pages=20  # default=10, max=20
)
```

**Why:**
- Helps plan targeted crawls vs full-site ingestion
- max_pages=20 hard limit requires multiple crawls for large sites
- Pattern stats show actual site structure for informed decisions

**Smart Sitemap Discovery:**
analyze_website() uses AsyncUrlSeeder which:
- Tries sitemap first (if available)
- Falls back to Common Crawl index (for sites without sitemaps)
- Discovers 150+ URLs even for sites without traditional sitemaps
Example: "https://docs.example.com/api" → discovers /api section structure

### Use Recrawl for Website Updates
```
Instead of: delete_document() + ingest_url()
Use: ingest_url(url, mode="recrawl", ...)
```

**Why:** Safer, maintains metadata tracking, cleaner knowledge base.

## 4. RAG vs GRAPH USAGE

**Use `search_documents` for:**
- Content semantically similar to query
- "What does knowledge base say about X?"

**Use `query_relationships` for:**
- Connections between entities
- "What is related to X?" or "How are A and B connected?"

**Use `query_temporal` for:**
- How knowledge evolved over time
- "How has X changed since 2023?"

**Pro tip:** Combine both - graph for connections, RAG for detailed content.

## 5. EFFICIENCY & COST AWARENESS

**Ingestion operations use AI models and have cost:**
- Every `ingest_*` call processes content with embeddings + LLMs
- Writes to both vector store and knowledge graph
- Cost varies by document size and complexity

**CRITICAL - INGESTION TIMING & TIMEOUT HANDLING:**

Processing time is non-deterministic and varies significantly. Examples observed:
- Single document: ~30 seconds to several minutes
- Directory: several minutes to extended processing time
- Website crawl: several minutes to extended processing time

Assess the scope of your specific request to estimate duration:
- Content size and complexity
- Number of files/documents/pages
- Crawl parameters (follow_links, max_depth, recursion)

**If client times out:** The operation CONTINUES on the server. Use
list_documents(collection_name, include_details=True) to verify completion
after waiting appropriate time based on your scope assessment.

Progress notifications track long-running operations for supporting clients.

**DUPLICATE REQUEST PROTECTION:**

If you submit the same ingestion request while one is already processing, you will receive:
```json
{"error": "This exact request is already processing (started Xs ago).
           Please wait for the current operation to complete.",
 "status": "duplicate_request"}
```

This prevents data corruption from concurrent identical operations. **If you see this error:**
1. **WAIT** - The original request is still processing on the server
2. **DO NOT retry immediately** - You'll get the same duplicate error
3. **Verify completion** using `list_documents(collection_name, include_details=True)`
4. **Only retry** after confirming the original request completed or failed

**Why this matters:** After a timeout, some MCP bridges (like OpenAI's) automatically retry with a new session. The duplicate protection catches this and prevents double-ingestion, which would corrupt your knowledge base with redundant data.

**Query operations are FREE** (local database):
- `search_documents`
- `query_relationships`
- `query_temporal`
- All list/view operations

**Best practices for efficiency:**
- Check for duplicates before ingesting (see #3)
- Use `update_document()` instead of re-ingesting
- Analyze large crawls before proceeding (see #3)
- Use recrawl mode for website updates (see #3)

## 6. COMMON PATTERNS

**Documentation Ingestion (Single Section):**
```
1. analyze_website(url) - understand scope and structure
2. Review total_urls and pattern_stats
3. create_collection(name, domain, description) - organize by source
4. ingest_url(url, follow_links=True, max_pages=20)
5. get_collection_info(name) - verify completion
```

**Documentation Ingestion (Multiple Sections):**
```
1. analyze_website("https://docs.example.com") - understand site structure
   → Shows: /api (45 pages), /guides (30 pages), /reference (25 pages)
2. create_collection(name, domain, description)

# Execute multiple targeted crawls based on pattern analysis
3. ingest_url("https://docs.example.com/api", follow_links=True, max_pages=20)
4. ingest_url("https://docs.example.com/guides", follow_links=True, max_pages=20)
5. ingest_url("https://docs.example.com/reference", follow_links=True, max_pages=20)

# Each crawl is independent - plan based on pattern_stats from analyze_website()
```

**Research Query:**
```
1. search_documents(query, collection) - find relevant content
2. query_relationships(query, collection) - find connections
3. Synthesize findings from both sources
```

**Maintenance:**
```
1. list_documents(collection) - identify stale docs
2. update_document(id) - refresh changed content
   OR ingest_url(url, mode="recrawl") - refresh websites
```
