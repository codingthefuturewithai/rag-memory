# Reference Audit Command Principles

**CRITICAL - Save this for when creating the audit command:**

## Core Principles

1. **NO hardcoded file paths** - Don't assume embeddings.py is in src/embeddings.py or anywhere specific
2. **NO hardcoded knowledge** of current .reference/ content or problems
3. **DISCOVERY-BASED** - Audit discovers where things are by searching the codebase
4. **INDEPENDENT** - An audit that knows what it's auditing defeats the purpose
5. **WORKS REGARDLESS** of refactoring, file moves, or .reference/ changes

## Command Design

- Give general pointers, not explicit instructions
- Don't tell the AI agent how to grep or count decorators
- Trust the agent to figure out verification methods
- Brief summary output (~10 lines per file)
- Ready to cite evidence if asked, but don't output 500 citations by default
- First-person active voice like getting-started.md ("I'm going to...")

## The Point

The audit's job is to DISCOVER the truth about what's in .reference/ vs what's actually in the source code. If the audit already knows intimate details about either, why audit at all?
